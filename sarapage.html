						I was born in Portugal, Porto. But I only lived ther for two years before I moved to Luxemburg where I spent most of my life. But I still visited my beautiful hometown regularly. Thats's were I enjoyed the ocean, the heat and my favorite dishes like francesinha, alheira and pasteis de nata.

						Luxemburg is where I grew up despite the very portuguese influence of my parents. It's also obviously the place I know the best, granted it's tiny which makes that a lot easier. But I do know it like the back of my pocket and I feel at home there. And it's also where all of my friends are and where I made all my friends.

					<h5>I'm a gamer</h5>
					
					<article class="text2">
						As you might have seen from the main page all members of our group are gamers. But it is one of the things I spend the most time on apart from my studies and dance. And unlike those hobbies gaming allows me to fully turn of my brain fully and relax physically and mentally at once. I usually play cozy games or fps games this includes games like valorant, Modern Warfare 2, Genshin Impact and Slime Rancher2.
